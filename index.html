                    <h1 class="albumReviewTitle">Queens of the Stone Age - <i>Villains</i></h1>
                    <p class="albumReviewContent"><i>Villains</i> has some of my favorite rock songs ever on it. <i>Feet Don't Fail Me</i> is an amazing opener, with a full, somewhat funky guitar in the background driving the core of the song. The funky guitars don't take away from the hard rock feel, though. The song <i>Domesticated Animals</i> follows suit with a similar hard rocking vibe, and a killer melody, especially at the end. <i>Fortress</i> has some amazing lyrics on it in addition to some great vocals from frontman Josh Homme. Stay tuned for a more in-depth review of this album.</p>

                    <p class="albumReviewContent"><i>Dirty Computer</i> is probably my favorite pop album that will come out in 2018. Songs like <i>Screwed</i> and <i>Make Me Feel</i> have an incredibly sweet pop sound with bubblegum guitars while rap on tracks like <i>Django Jane</i> show off Monae's huge talent range. The (sometimes direct) statements on race and gender are also not to be understated. With this album, Monae does a fantastic job of creating a series of irresistably catchy pop tunes with real meaning behind the music.</p>

                    <h1 class="albumReviewTitle">JPEGMAFIA - <i>Veteran</i></h1>
                    <p class="albumReviewContent">From the smooth, soothing synths on <i>1539 N. Calvert</i> to the jarring geiger-counteresque clicking that introduces <i>Thug Tears</i>, <i>Veteran</i> is a striking project. Peggy brings some of the most energized and inventive verses I've heard in the past year on top of production that beautifully transitions between off-the-wall highs and brooding, spiteful lows. <i>Veteran</i> strikes a near-perfect balance between experimental and calculated, leaving a lasting impression on the listener.</p>

                    <p class="albumReviewContent">Although <i>Boarding House Reach</i> is not an easy listen, it is passion-packed, making it Jack White's most entertaining solo album yet. White seems to really be losing his mind, shown in his frighteningly brilliant vocal performance; on tracks like <i>Connected By Love</i>, he sounds as if his mind could break to the point of insanity at any moment, delivering lines such as "Let's put it all to bed / forgive me, and save my from myself" with an urgency that begs the listener to take White seriously.</p>
